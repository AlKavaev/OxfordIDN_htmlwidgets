```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Templates are organised as follows:

```
chartType
---------| index.html
---------| shiny_Folder
-----------------------| ui.R
-----------------------| server.R
```

The index.html file contains a very basic description of the chartType discussed in the templates, and instructions on how to construct the chartType with a variety of different libraries (if possible). This file can be viewed at the following address:

Where multiple libraries are capable of making comparable visualisations, a shiny app is provided to compare these at the following address:
