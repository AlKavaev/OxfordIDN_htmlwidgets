<p>
This Shiny app demonstrates the ability to use the `datatables` library to visualise data loaded from an external database and paginated server-side, see <a href="http://martinjhnhadley.github.io/OxfordIDN_htmlwidgets/datatable/#server_side_processing">here</a> for further details and note that the example is based on <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/DT/server.html">this</a>.
<p>


<p>Note that the interactive provided within the `datatable` itself is provided entirely by the `htmlwidget` library and not dependent on Shiny. This app has a minimal interactive element that does depend on Shiny:

- Select rows in the `datatable` and a list of the first names from the selected rows will be shown.

<p>The code for this shiny app is available on <a href="https://github.com/martinjhnhadley/OxfordIDN_htmlwidgets/tree/gh-pages/datatable/server-side-datatable_shiny">GitHub</a></p>
