## timevis

The `timevis` library uses the vis.js library to build impressive interactive gantt charts and timelines, with good support for both instantaneous and non-instantaneous event series. Documentation for the library is available [https://github.com/daattali/timevis] and an [interactive guide](http://daattali.com/shiny/timevis-demo/) including advanced shiny functionality has also been published by the developer.

Like many libraries, the workhorse of the library (`timevis`) expects a specially formatted `data.frame`. Note that at the time of writing (July 2016) the library does not support tooltips.

- id: Unique for each row
- content: Gantt label
- start: start date for each event
- end: end date for each event
- title: hover text

Let us create a version of `timeline_data` with this format and provide this directly to `timevis` for visualisation, note that there is not a seperate line for each data.

```{r}
timevis_data <- data.frame(
  "id" = 1:nrow(timeline_data),
  "content" = timeline_data$Prime.Minister,
  "start" = timeline_data$Start.Date,
  "end" = timeline_data$End.Date,
  "title" = timeline_data$Political.Party
)
library(timevis)
timevis(timevis_data)
```
