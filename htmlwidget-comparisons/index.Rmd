# Comparison of htmlwidgets

In order to compare htmlwidget libraries we must define a set of visualisations and visualisation categories:

- Charts: for comparatie visualisations
- Nerworks: connections
- Maps: maps

Shiny apps to achieve the following:

- What types of visualisations can be made by what library?
- How are visualisations grouped?
- What visualisation for what data?
